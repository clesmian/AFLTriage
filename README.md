# AFLTriage
A parallel AFL crash triaging tool in Rust that uses GDB.
It is designed to be standalone and not require any run-time dependencies, besides GDB.

## Building and Running
Once you have cargo and rust installed, building and running is simple:

```
cd afltriage-rs/
cargo run --help

<compilation>

    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.33s
     Running `target/debug/afltriage --help`

afltriage 0.1.0
Quickly triage crashing outputs generated by AFL

USAGE:
    afltriage -i <afldir> [BINARY]...

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -i <afldir>        The path to the AFL directory to triage crashes from

ARGS:
    <BINARY>...    The executable and args to execute, otherwise will attempt to guess based off of AFL
                   fuzzer_stats.
```

You can then run the triager on an afl directory:

```
./target/debug/afltriage -i afl_output_dir/ ./path_to_binary --binary args
```
